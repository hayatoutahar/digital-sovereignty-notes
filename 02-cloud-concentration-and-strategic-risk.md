# Cloud concentration and strategic risk

## Problem
Cloud markets concentrate around a few hyperscalers. This concentration increases systemic risk and constrains strategic autonomy.

## Key points
- Lock-in emerges through proprietary services, data gravity, and ecosystem dependencies.
- Operational resilience depends on contractual terms, auditability, and exit plans.
- Sovereignty does not require a national cloud. It requires enforceable control points.

## Strategic implications
- Multi-cloud strategies work when designed for portability from the start.
- Procurement must include reversibility requirements and measurable exit criteria.
- Security posture improves when governance of access, logs, and incident response is explicit.
