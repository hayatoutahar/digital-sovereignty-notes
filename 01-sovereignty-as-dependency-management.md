# Sovereignty as dependency management

## Core idea
Digital sovereignty can be framed as the capacity to choose, to negotiate, and to recover. It depends on the quality of dependencies, not on the absence of dependencies.

## Key points
- Every digital system relies on supply chains: infrastructure, software, standards, talent, capital.
- Sovereignty means mapping critical dependencies and managing concentration risks.
- Diversification, interoperability, and reversibility create room for manoeuvre.

## Strategic implications
- Dependency becomes geopolitical when switching costs rise.
- Public procurement shapes ecosystems through standards and long-term contracts.
- Resilience strategies require technical architecture and governance architecture.
