# AI governance and accountability

## Problem
AI systems create decision automation. This increases the need for accountability, transparency and institutional oversight.

## Key points
- Governance includes: model risk management, data governance, human oversight and audit trails.
- Accountability requires clear ownership: who answers for failures, bias or harms.
- Public trust depends on explainability, contestability and continuous monitoring.

## Strategic implications
- Organisations need governance frameworks before large-scale deployment.
- Regulatory compliance is a baseline. Strategic advantage comes from operational maturity.
- AI sovereignty relies on compute access, talent and control over critical datasets.
